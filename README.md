Falcon bird defines the dynamics ,here Falcon defines a “Co-ordinate controlled bot ” .

Background

Drawbacks are the asset for new research ,few months back we worked on Bluetooth controlled bot .The main draw back was that we did not had feedback on the distance traveled and orientation in the space ,keeping this objective in mind we started to work on the feedback system.

The feedback system that we were looking should fetch us the distance traveled and the angle it is aligned in space , “Encoders and gyroscope” would do us the job . keeping ourselves resisted to distance feedback we have designed a bot that would travel the distance that we send as a parameter later by using concepts trigonometry turning to an angle that we desired was achieved .
